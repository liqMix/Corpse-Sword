# Corpse Sword (tentative)
My contribution to a community learning exercise for building a RogueLike game.
https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/

# Description
I plan to use this project to explore multiple systems that I do not have much experience in.

# Goals/Features
 - Unique weapon upgrade system
	- All items (including corpses) have inherent stats
        - Your weapon has a number of slots these items can be put in to
	- Slotted items interact with adjacent items, either boosting or reducing certain stats
 - Procedurally generated randomized maps
	- Still looking for a unique source of noise to seed
 - Multiple element types - the usual suspects (fire, water, earth, ...)
 - Enemy type and strength sourced from public record inmate API
	- Arson -> fire type
	- DUI   -> water type
	- ...
 - HTML embedded as well as executable
